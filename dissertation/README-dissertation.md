####Dissertation Abstract
Collaborative design is a complex cognitive and social activity
that requires coordination of both processes and products between its
participants. Information required for this coordinative activity are
descriptions of the various tasks and products found within a design project,
and of the current state of these entities. State descriptions can arise from
technical analysis, perhaps employing automated, machine-based methods, or can
arise from a social process of consensual, collaborative assessment that
results in design team members applying informal linguistic descriptions to
processes. In the event that no automated process exists for state
determination, then members of the design team must work together and find a
mutually agreeable assessment of state. With this information designers are
better able to determine the progress and status of a design process, and to
assess their roles and responsibilities within a design team.

This research describes the design and implementation of a design support tool
that enables distributed teams to collaboratively determine the state of
design entities, such as tasks and products. The tool is role-based, and
enables users to communicate simple looped state-transition models that they
feel suitably describe the possible states and transitions that a design
entity could experience. These state models can describe the degree of
completion, degree of acceptance within a team, or progress with respect to a
series of milestones. By attaching entities to simple state-transition loops,
users make input based on simple questions about the state of individual
entities, rather than complex ones arising from the interaction of entities.
Complex branching process structures can be created by composing entities. The
tool automatically handles state assessment of complex, linked compositions of
entities, while users handle assessment of simple, non-linked entities. It
provides users with information regarding design state and structure, and
supports a form of bottom-up design coordination that requires no centralized
policies or inputs, prior to deployment.
