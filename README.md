###Design Process Modeler

Design Process Modeler (DPM) is software written in Java that employs Sun's JXTA peer to peer framework. It was written by Michael Cumming 2003-2005 as part of his PhD in Computational Design at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Architecture. 

It basic idea is to allow composition of process models, which are structured as loops. These process models are based on a socio-technical model of design process that is highly interactive with members of the design process, as opposed to processes of design that static, or determined by technical design requirements. This encourages an iterative approach to design during which design problems are explored and articulated by design team members.
